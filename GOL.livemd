# Game of Life

## Whats the Goal?

### Design a Game of life program

It allows you to set a starting state and then run the board through n iterations and print the final state.

The 'game' itself runs on an infinite 2-D board with each cell being either on on or off.
Each iteration a Cell can change from on to off or stay in its state.

<!-- The rules: #Dfdsfdsfdsfdsfdsffdsfdsfdsfdsfdsdfsfdsfdsfdsnfdsfdsfdsfdsff -->

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

```elixir
# Define the Cells
defmodule Cell do
  defstruct x: 0, y: 0, print_char: "⬛️", is_active: false

  def neighbour_tuples(cell) do
    [
      {cell.x - 1, cell.y - 1},
      {cell.x, cell.y - 1},
      {cell.x + 1, cell.y - 1},
      {cell.x - 1, cell.y},
      {cell.x + 1, cell.y},
      {cell.x - 1, cell.y + 1},
      {cell.x, cell.y + 1},
      {cell.x + 1, cell.y + 1}
    ]
  end
end
```

```elixir
# Test Cells struct
1..10
|> Enum.map(fn x -> %Cell{x: x, y: x} end)
|> Enum.map(fn cell -> cell.print_char end)
```

### Setup the board

The cells live on a 2-D board so we have a few options for storing the cells.  We can only store the live cells for that 
generation, but that raises issues when trying to implement the 2nd rule Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.

I am going to start down this path and see where I get to

```elixir
# Defining the board
defmodule Board do
  defstruct cells: []

  def count_cells(board) do
    Enum.count(board.cells)
  end
end
```

```elixir
# Test Board
cell = %Cell{}
board = %Board{cells: [cell]}
Board.count_cells(board)
```

So we have the structures in place - I am going to redefine the module to start adding some functions for counting cell neighbours

```elixir
defmodule Board do
  defstruct cells: []

  def count_neighbours(board, cell) do
    board.cells
    |> Enum.filter(fn c -> is_neighbour(cell, c) end)
    |> Enum.count()
  end

  def is_neighbour(cell, c) do
    Enum.any?(Cell.neighbour_tuples(cell), fn c_tuple -> c_tuple == {c.x, c.y} end)
  end
end
```

```elixir
cell = %Cell{x: -1, y: -1}
board = %Board{cells: [%Cell{x: 0, y: 0}, cell]}
Board.count_neighbours(board, cell)
```

We have the beasics in place, a board, cell and ability to calculate the number of neighbours.  Now time to implement the rules.

One of the stumbling blocks is how to setup and initial state and if the board structure should only have alive cells or all cells with a boolean on / off

I have decided that every cell should be a cell struct, so added a filter on the count neighbours to take it into account.

```elixir
defmodule Board do
  defstruct cells: []

  def setup(x, y, active) do
    for i <- 1..x,
        j <- 1..y,
        do: %Cell{x: i, y: j, is_active: Enum.any?(active, fn t -> t == {i, j} end)}
  end

  def count_neighbours(board, cell) do
    board.cells
    |> Enum.filter(fn c -> c.is_active end)
    |> Enum.filter(fn c -> is_neighbour(cell, c) end)
    |> Enum.count()
  end

  def is_neighbour(cell, c) do
    Enum.any?(Cell.neighbour_tuples(cell), fn c_tuple -> c_tuple == {c.x, c.y} end)
  end
end
```

```elixir
Board.setup(10, 10, [{1, 1}])
```

We now have a way of setting up the board, now we need to have a way of advancing the board, one step, this means going through each cell, counting the neighbours and changing the state

```elixir
defmodule Board do
  defstruct cells: []

  def setup(x, y, active) do
    for i <- 1..x,
        j <- 1..y,
        do: %Cell{x: i, y: j, is_active: Enum.any?(active, fn t -> t == {i, j} end)}
  end

  def advance(board) do
    board
    |> Enum.map(fn cell -> update_cell(board, cell) end)
  end

  def draw(board) do
    board
    |> Enum.map(fn cell ->
      if cell.is_active do
        cell.print_char
      else
        "⬜️"
      end
    end)
    |> Enum.chunk_every(5)
  end

  def update_cell(board, cell) do
    case count_neighbours(board, cell) do
      3 -> Map.replace(cell, :is_active, true)
      2 -> Map.replace(cell, :is_active, cell.is_active)
      _ -> Map.replace(cell, :is_active, false)
    end
  end

  def count_neighbours(board, cell) do
    board
    |> Enum.filter(fn c -> c.is_active end)
    |> Enum.filter(fn c -> is_neighbour(cell, c) end)
    |> Enum.count()
  end

  def is_neighbour(cell, c) do
    Enum.any?(Cell.neighbour_tuples(cell), fn c_tuple -> c_tuple == {c.x, c.y} end)
  end
end
```

```elixir
board =
  Board.setup(5, 5, [{3, 2}, {3, 3}, {3, 4}])
  |> Board.advance()
  # |> Board.advance()
  |> Board.draw()
```
