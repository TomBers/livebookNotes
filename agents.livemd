# Agents

## A simpler Genserver

An Agent is a way of getting many of the benefits of a Genserver to store state with a simple interface.

You can basically either read the current state, or update it (there is a command to do both at the same time)

```elixir
{:ok, agent} = Agent.start_link(fn -> 4 end)
```

```elixir
Agent.update(agent, fn state -> state + 1 end)
```

```elixir
Agent.get(agent, fn state -> state end)
```

```elixir
val = Agent.get_and_update(agent, fn state -> {state, state + 1} end)
```

```elixir
Agent.get(agent, fn state -> state end)
```

```elixir
Agent.stop(agent)
```
